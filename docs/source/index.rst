Welcome to geospacepy-lite's documentation!
===========================================

Geospacepy-lite is a toolbox of loosely-related modules which were originally
created for analyzing in-situ sensed electrodynamics and particle precipitation data from spacecraft, but are general-purpose enough to useful for various common geospace data analysis tasks.

.. note::
	
	Where multiple versions of an algorithm exist, this code generally implements the most approximate simple-minded version. It's a place to start and get an approximate solution to a particular problem.

The dependacies of the package are limited as much as possible to the core scientific python packages like the standard library, numpy, and matplotlib.

Algorithms implemented in Geospacepy-lite come from many sources, and I attempt to cite each algorithm within it's docstring, but a majority of them are from:

Vallado, D. A., & McClain, W. D. (2007). Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications (3rd edition). Hawthorne, Calif.: Microcosm Press/Springer.
