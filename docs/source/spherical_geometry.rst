spherical_geometry
==================

This module implements various algorithms from spherical geometry which
are useful in geospace or spacecraft data analysis.

For example, one algorithm implemented here can be used to integrate 
values sampled on a regular latitude/longitude grid at a single altitude, 
which is a common format of geospace model output.
